A Protégé 4 plug-in for Visual Ontology Edition. Violet is a plugin that enables the visual edition of ontologies in the widely-used application Protégé. The plug-in is 100% integrated with Protégé and enables drag-and-drop of OWL entities to the diagrams. The editor is based in the [GEF library](http://gef.tigris.org), OWL-API and Protégé API.

It is currently it is alpha version and we only guarantee that it is 100% functional in MacOS X.

We also plan to add new exciting features, like the support for ontology views, definition of domain/application ontologies, exploiting the new features of OWL 2 and much more!
